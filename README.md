# SmartRound
This EXILED plugin will restart the server if there is only 1 player in-game.


## How it works
When only 1 player remains in the round, and in an amount of second configurable in configs nobody join, to the 1 player the plugin will send a broadcast, configurable, and the server will restart after the broadcast has ended
